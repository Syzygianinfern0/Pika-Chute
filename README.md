# Pika-Chute

Pika is a fully featured, dynamic programming language. It has a modern, easy to use, syntax with a long and growing list of features. Pika is cross-platform and runs on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, BSD, and should compile on any POSIX operating system. It is free software released under the zlib/libpng license and can be used for commercial, personal, open source and educational projects.

## Want to get started?

Then download the latest version, [Pika 0.12.0](http://www.pika-lang.org/downloads/), and check out the [documentation](http://www.pika-lang.org/documentation/).

### Meanwhile look at [this](https://youtu.be/700clVx5l9E) and [this](http://trove42.com/introducing-pikachu-programming-language/)

I plan to learn this language (and also try to make a pikachu-python translator if I get enough time)

Or maybe this repo will become a fun-tricks-with-pika.
